## Dev Notes
To Be Warned: This site is one I would never make for a client. I clearly don't want to waste much time or effort creating this so I'm not going to worry much about SEO, security, or performance. It's just simply ment to be a site I can easily host statically from anywhere and link off to other, -better websites.
